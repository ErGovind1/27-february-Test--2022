    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Interest is the monetary charge for borrowing moneyâ€”generally expressed as a percentage, such as an annual percentage rate (APR).
    Key factors affecting interest rates include inflation rate, length of time the money is borrowed, liquidity, and risk of default.
    Interest can also express ownership in a company.
